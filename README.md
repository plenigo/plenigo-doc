# Frisbii Media API documentation

Welcome to the official Frisbii Media API documentation.

**As we transition from plenigo to Frisbii Media, you may still encounter the name "plenigo" throughout this documentation. This is simply due to the ongoing rebranding process - rest assured, plenigo and Frisbii Media are the same platform, and all functionalities, APIs, and integrations remain unchanged.**

**All existing API endpoints will continue to function as usual. We will gradually introduce new endpoints under the Frisbii Media brand and phase out the old ones. You will receive advance notice along with detailed migration guidance well ahead of any changes. The API documentation will be updated accordingly to reflect the new brand.**

**We appreciate your understanding and are excited to continue supporting you under our new name!**
